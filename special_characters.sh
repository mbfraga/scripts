# Creates a menu of special characters via dmenu or rofi Once a character is
# selected, it is pasted to the cursor via xdotool symbols can be added with
# any keyword, but make sure to keep the syntax
#
# syntax: keyword    :$symbol
#
# $symbol will be the characters printed via xdotool. Anything between the
# colon and the \n (linebreak) will be pasted, excluding trailing whitespace.
#
# note1: By modifying 'sep', a different character rather than colon could be
# used, in case some of the symbols desired have colons in them. For my purpose,
# this has never been the case.
#
# note2: The xdotool is given a delay because of issues I've had with printing
# long smileys, this could be removed if only single-character symbols are
# desired, and it may improve the experience.
